# Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
  - Week 7 : Basic Data Analysis (Pandas & Matplotlib

      # Objectives
## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset
1. Choose a dataset in CSV format (for example, you can use datasets like the Iris dataset, a sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
   
2. Load the dataset using pandas.
3. Display the first few rows of the dataset using .head() to inspect the data.
4. Explore the structure of the dataset by checking the data types and any missing values.
5. Clean the dataset by either filling or dropping any missing values.

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
1. Compute the basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using .describe().
2. Perform groupings on a categorical column (for example, species, region, or department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.
3. Identify any patterns or interesting findings from your analysis.

## Task 3: Data Visualization
1. Create at least four different types of visualizations:
2. Line chart showing trends over time (for example, a time-series of sales data).
3. Bar chart showing the comparison of a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
4. Histogram of a numerical column to understand its distribution.
5. Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).
6. Customize your plots with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.

# Solution
This repo contains a data.csv (sales_data.csv) used to load and analyze datasets using the pandas library in Python as well as create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data. 

The Jupyter notebook (sales.ipynb file) contains: 
- Data loading and exploration steps.
- Basic data analysis results.
- Visualizations.
